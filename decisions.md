# Decisions Log

Append-only audit trail of approvals, amendments, backward steps, and conditional-skip
rationales for the lifecycle. See [[state-persistence]] for the schema.

Note: this repo already keeps a rich technical decision + verification log at
`docs/DECISION-LOG.md` (PRD approvals/amendments, the model-refusal rerun evidence, the
Nova A/B). That remains the detailed record. This file carries lifecycle phase-transition
entries from init-state forward.

## 2026-07-05 · init · state persistence initialized

init-state migrated the pre-lifecycle `PROJECT_STATE.md` to the lifecycle schema (header
prepended, 812-line body preserved). Deduced Phase 1.3 (PRD 35 sealed at
2026-07-03T19:59:22Z, sha256 5e110e425e70; Phase 2 M1 pending). Prior lifecycle events
(PRD 35 approval / amendment / re-approval) are recorded in `docs/DECISION-LOG.md` and are
not re-imported here.

## 2026-07-07 · skip · §4.6-d (per-cluster model tier) deferred

Michael deferred §4.6-d (per-cluster tier -> Agent modelConfig patch), the last of PRD 35 M1's
sub-pieces. It is a CONDITIONAL skip with a recorded reason (not a silent drop):

- "Nova everywhere" is the gitops default, so per-cluster tier only serves the OPTIONAL cost-race
  demo, which is not currently wanted.
- Both viable implementations wrangle ArgoCD reconciliation: (a) live-patch = suspend the ai-layer
  app's selfHeal, patch the Agent modelConfig, bounce the pod; (b) the PRD-preferred "overlay" =
  patch the ai-layer ArgoCD Application's kustomize.patches per cluster, which the app-of-apps parent
  reverts unless given ignoreDifferences. Neither is friction-free, so the PRD's "not a live patch"
  preference did not survive contact with the shared-gitops + app-of-apps + selfHeal architecture.
- The tier column stays plumbed (roster + dry-run show it) but is inert until this lands.

Consequence: PRD 35 M1 is COMPLETE at 4 of 5 sub-pieces (IMDS pin, §4.6 core, AWS root relocation,
provider dispatch — all on main). Revisit §4.6-d only if the cost-race demo is wanted; the live-patch
route is the recommended implementation, and a one-line PRD note would capture that the overlay
preference is impractical here. The sealed PRD 35 body is unchanged (this is a documented deferral in
the audit log, not a plan amendment).

## 2026-09-03T18:20:00Z · 2.2 · Rejected approaches for rolling a proxy.py change

### REJECTED: Per-generator `options: disableNameSuffixHash: false` on `guard-proxy-src`
**Why:** kustomize v5.8.1 lets the top-level `generatorOptions` win over a per-generator
`options:` block. Confirmed with a minimal two-generator build: one generator asking for a
hash and one not both produced unsuffixed names. The field is accepted and silently has no
effect, which is worse than an error.
**Status:** Permanent for kustomize v5.x as shipped in kubectl v1.37.
**Do not suggest:** moving the `options:` key, reordering the generators, or setting
`disableNameSuffixHash: false` on the generator alone. All three hit the same precedence.

### REJECTED: Drop the global `generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash`
**Why:** It would hash every generated ConfigMap in the ai-layer bundle, not just the
proxy source, days before Portland. Kustomize rewrites the references it owns, but the
blast radius covers `evil-mcp-src`, `workshop-mcp-src`, `chat-ui-src` and the rest, and the
stable names are relied on by `agent/gateway/guard-proxy/guard-proxy.yaml` and by the
`kubectl create configmap` line documented in it.
**Status:** Revisit between events, when a wider rename can be tested on one cluster first.
**Do not suggest:** doing it as part of a security fix. The two changes have nothing to do
with each other and bundling them makes both harder to revert.

### REJECTED: `kubectl rollout restart` across the fleet
**Why:** The fleet's admission policy rejects direct mutation by a non-ArgoCD principal, and
it is right to. Eleven of thirteen clusters refused; `r1-1` and `r1-2` accepted, which is
itself worth a look since the policy is evidently not uniform.
**Status:** Permanent. Changes travel through Git.
**Do not suggest:** a one-off restart to "just get it live", including via a Job or a
scaled-to-zero-and-back. The policy exists so the running state matches the repo.

**Chosen:** a `checksum/proxy-py` annotation on the guard-proxy pod template, bumped in the
same commit as a proxy.py change, with `verify/test_proxy_checksum.py` failing when the two
disagree. Keeps the stable ConfigMap names, makes the rollout automatic once the annotation
moves, and turns a forgotten bump into a red test instead of a silent no-op in the room.

## 2026-09-06T13:30:00Z · 2.2 · Supersedes "Drop the global generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash" (rejected 2026-09-03)

The 2026-09-03 rejection was conditional: "Revisit between events, when a wider rename can be tested
on one cluster first." The condition changed on 2026-09-06: the owner directed that every fix be wired
so it needs no manual step, four freshly rebuilt clusters exist to prove the rename on before Sunday's
full rebuild, and the one runtime reliance the rejection named (`agent/gateway/guard-proxy/guard-proxy.yaml`)
is a hand-apply manifest nothing in gitops, infra or verify applies. The hash is now ON for the whole
ai-layer bundle; `verify/test_ai_layer_rollout.py` asserts it, and asserts that editing lab.html changes
the console pod template. The `checksum/proxy-py` annotation and its test stay: `/controls` reports that
checksum in the room, which is a different job from rolling the pod. Issue #252.

## 2026-09-17T15:40:00Z · 1.2 · Gitea is not part of this IDP, and the reason was never written down

Asked why the IDP has no Gitea. It has none, and searching this repo for "gitea" returns nothing at
all: not a manifest, not a note, not a rejection. The absence was undocumented, which is the actual
defect here. A decision nobody recorded gets re-litigated, and this one had already reached the point
of being asked.

**What is true.** The sister project (`events/Packt-agentic-devops`) does run Gitea, at
`solution/platform/1-foundation/gitea`, beside openbao, argo-rollouts and argo-workflows. Its own
ABOUTME states the purpose exactly:

> in-cluster Gitea installed at PROVISIONING time, so ArgoCD can source the platform manifests from
> inside the cluster instead of from GitHub

The port commit that founded this platform (`6880677`, "Port KubeAuto IDP foundation") brought **zero**
Gitea files.

### REJECTED: add Gitea to the Watch It Burn IDP

**Why:** it solves a problem this workshop does not have. Gitea exists in the sister project because
its students sync the platform from **inside** the cluster, editing manifests in an in-cluster git
service as a teaching beat. Our Argo CD sources directly from GitHub through the `witb-repo` secret
and a `gh` token, and no challenge asks a student to commit anything. Adding Gitea would add a
StatefulSet, a database, a credential and a sync path that nothing in the eight challenges exercises,
on a platform already at 38 Applications that must build in 15 to 25 minutes, 50 times over.

**Status:** Revisit when a challenge genuinely needs in-cluster git. The obvious candidate is a
supply-chain or GitOps-tampering beat, where the student modifies a manifest and watches Argo CD or
the drift policy react. That is a real workshop idea and Gitea would be the right way to build it. It
does not exist today.

**Do not suggest:** adding Gitea "for completeness" or because the sister repo has it; mirroring the
GitHub repo into the cluster purely to remove the GitHub dependency (the token path works and is one
secret); or treating its absence as an oversight from the port. The port was manifests-only by
design, and the same mechanism is why `kubeauto-unicorn-party:2.0.2` did not come across either: its
content lived inside an image in a foreign ECR registry rather than in a manifest.

## 2026-10-05T00:00:00Z · 1.3 · Component repos, the guard-proxy rewrite, and the upstream mirror

Five decisions from Michael, taken one at a time on 2026-10-05, closing the open questions on #411,
#412 and #416.

**Component repos (#411).** guard-proxy and the LLM Guard offline image each get their own repo,
wired back here as git submodules (submodules chosen 2026-09-24):

| Component | Repo | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| guard-proxy | `peopleforrester/guard-proxy-agenticburn` | public |
| LLM Guard offline image | `peopleforrester/llm-guard-cpu-offline` | public |

Both public, matching this repo and the images, which are already anonymously pullable. Neither holds
a secret: the cosign signing key lives in mrf-secrets.

**guard-proxy is rewritten in Go (#412).** Michael's reasoning: it is going to become a product
quickly, and Go has better libraries for this than Rust. This reverses the recommendation in the
2026-09-22 research synthesis, which was to keep it in Python as the workshop's demo object; that
recommendation assumed it stayed a teaching prop, and it does not.

The rewrite also folds in what LiteLLM does better. The research established that LiteLLM's
pre-call budget reservation (estimate the request's maximum cost, reserve it, reject before the
provider is called) is a stronger mechanism than guard-proxy's post-hoc metering, which blocks only
the next request. That gap analysis is the first deliverable of the rewrite, ahead of any Go code.

**Upstream mirror (#416).** `peopleforrester/llm-guard-upstream-mirror`, private. A backup so builds
survive if Protect AI deletes the archived repo; it invites nothing and promises nothing. The public
offering is `llm-guard-cpu-offline`. Forking and maintaining the library (decision B) stays declined
on the cost measured in the 2026-09-22 research.

## 2026-10-11T00:00:00Z · 1.2 · PRD #412 open questions answered

Michael answered the five open questions in `prds/412-guard-proxy-go-rewrite.md`, one at a time:

1. Token counting is exact, via Bedrock `CountTokens`, with no estimator fallback: a request whose
   count cannot be produced is refused.
2. Budget state persists across restarts in an embedded store (SQLite or bbolt), so a restart cannot
   reset a budget. Still no Postgres.
3. The workshop apparatus (live prompt feed, `/controls`, `/toggle`) ships in the product. Design
   consequence recorded in the PRD: the prompt feed is off by default and the admin API is
   authenticated, because the feed streams user prompts.
4. The code fast-edit loop is retired. Code reaches a cluster only as a signed, digest-pinned image;
   behavior still changes live through the YAML config and the toggles.
5. License is Apache-2.0. `proxy.py` keeps its MIT notice, because its LICENSE names Michael Forrester
   and Whitney Lee as holders and relicensing it would need both. The Go code is new and is
   Apache-2.0 from its first commit.

The plan as a whole still needs approval (1.3) before any Go is written.

## 2026-10-10T23:36:09Z · 1.3 · PRD #412 approved: guard-proxy rewritten in Go

Approved-by: Michael@2026-10-10T23:36:09Z
Plan: `prds/412-guard-proxy-go-rewrite.md` (sha256:3a5aa82f1a71f5c30360c684aa873704df14374e9468b63e50bc7d5fd118ac73)

Approved as written, after Michael answered its five open questions one at a time and the known bugs
on the new proxy's path were classified (#382 and #320 deferred against a Python baseline, #333 a
prerequisite for M7). The plan is now read-only; changes go through an amendment.

Work starts at M0: a black-box HTTP conformance suite that must pass against the Python proxy before
any Go is written. It lives in guard-proxy-agenticburn, beside the implementation it constrains.

## 2026-10-11T00:29:21Z · 2.1 · PRD #412 M0 complete: conformance suite pinned to proxy.py

The suite lives in guard-proxy-agenticburn `conformance/`, beside the code it constrains. It runs
any implementation as a subprocess through `GUARD_PROXY_CMD` against real local fakes for the agent
and the LLM Guard API, and asserts only client-observable behavior. Result: 163 tests green against
proxy.py, CI green on c72cc28, promoted to that repo's main.

Proof that it constrains anything: `mutation_check.py` breaks proxy.py 16 ways (fail-open default,
case-sensitive block-list, ignored classifier verdict, scrub gaps, cap and rate-limit off-by-ones,
session-blind budget, wrong price, probe in feed, no retries, CORS echo, credential forwarding).
All 16 are caught. The first run let the cost-cap off-by-one escape; the boundary tests that close
it were added, and a budget-cap mutant with them.

Scope clarifications, within the sealed plan rather than amendments:
- Telemetry assertions are deferred to M5, whose acceptance is already a recorded Python baseline.
  The Python proxy only emits spans under the OTel SDK the cluster injects, so the harness cannot
  observe them without reproducing that injection.
- `/controls` is covered for the no-credentials case only. proxy.py hardcodes the API host; the Go
  implementation adds an endpoint override and the suite extends then.

Defects found while pinning behavior are asserted as they stand (tests ending `_today`) and filed on
guard-proxy-agenticburn: #1 (a failed reasoning-only retry writes two responses and drops the usable
reply), #2 (raw `<thinking></thinking>` tags reach the student), #3 (retry tokens are never metered,
so `/cost` and both caps undercount), #4 (feed moderation misses capitalized terms). Per the
fix-shared-bugs rule these sit on the Go proxy's path. #3 bears directly on the M3 claim that a
single request cannot exceed the cap, so it must be fixed in both implementations before M3 is
accepted. #1, #2 and #4 can be fixed in either order, as long as proxy.py and its `_today` test
change together.

## 2026-10-14T00:00:00Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 M1 complete: Go skeleton passes the pass-through conformance subset

guard-proxy-agenticburn 1874403, CI green (run 38490687225), promoted. "Pass-through cases" is now a
pytest marker, `passthrough`, on 22 tests: /guards seeding, the GET passthrough and its 502s, A2A
forwarding with every guard off, agent failures as 502 with a `forward_error` ERROR log, and OPTIONS
as 501. Each later milestone widens the selection; proxy.py always runs all 163. Choices made inside
the contract, each recorded so a later milestone does not re-derive it:
- Go 1.27.2 rather than the PRD's 1.27.1: 1.27.2 (2026-10-08) carries `net/http` security fixes. An
  upward patch, so no amendment is needed.
- The agent URL is required. proxy.py defaults to a workshop hostname; the manifests set AGENT_URL
  explicitly (resources.yaml), so nothing deployed depends on the default.
- `PROXY_TIMEOUT` becomes a total deadline (`http.Client.Timeout`). urllib's is per socket operation.
- Routes later milestones build (/chat, /cost, /prompts, /controls, /toggle) answer 501 instead of
  being forwarded to the agent as A2A traffic. `/healthz` is new and is answered locally.
- Log timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC; proxy.py writes Python's local `formatTime`. Keys and level names
  match, including WARNING.
- Licensing: Apache-2.0 in `LICENSE` for the Go code. proxy.py and `conformance/` keep MIT, moved to
  `LICENSE-MIT`, because both were committed under the MIT notice naming Michael and Whitney.
- The upstream hop is a rebuilt request on `http.Client`, not `httputil.ReverseProxy`, because the
  reference sends only the body and a JSON Content-Type.

Also closed #415 (all items done or tracked on #412 and llm-coding-workflow#182) and corrected the
state file, which still said the cosign key existed only on netcup after mrf-secrets#4 had closed.

## 2026-10-14T21:40:00Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 M2 complete on the A2A path; /chat guard cases wait for /chat

guard-proxy-agenticburn 0679083, CI green (run 38640241252), promoted. A second marker, `guards`,
covers the 22 guard cases on the A2A path: the block-list, the LLM Guard classifier, the output guard
over artifacts, agent history and status, and fail-closed or fail-open for each failure mode. The Go
build runs `-m "passthrough or guards"`, 44 tests; proxy.py still runs all 163. Choices made inside
the contract:
- **Scope.** The guard cases on `/chat` (test_chat_path.py) and the live-toggle case need the `/chat`
  route and `/toggle`, which carry per-call cost, retries and toggles from M3 and M4. They join when
  those routes do. The guard logic is shared, so they exercise the same code. Consequence: the PRD's
  "M0 through M2 is the minimum to replace the Python in the workshop" does not hold. The workshop
  needs `/chat` and `/toggle`, so the earliest replacement point is M4.
- **The output guard calls LLM Guard's `/analyze/output`, as proxy.py does.** The PRD's milestone
  says "regex output"; the regex is LLM Guard's Regex scanner, server side. A regex guard inside the
  proxy would be a new guard rather than parity, and no conformance case asks for one.
- `llm_guard.url` (or `LLM_GUARD_URL`) is required, like the agent URL; the manifests set it.
- `PROXY_FAIL_CLOSED` accepts only true or false. proxy.py treats any other value as false, so a typo
  turned fail-closed off.
- A scanner failure logs `guard_error` at WARNING. proxy.py fails, open or closed, without a log line.
- `LLM_GUARD_TOKEN` is environment only, never in the YAML; with no token no Authorization header is
  sent, instead of `Bearer ` with nothing after it.
- Guards are concrete types (a Blocklist, an LLM Guard client) rather than the PRD's Go interface.
  The interface arrives with a second implementation (Bedrock ApplyGuardrail), when its shape is known.

Correction to the prior entry: its timestamp `2026-10-14T00:00:00Z` is a placeholder. The M1 record
was committed at 2026-10-14T00:35:44Z (152485f).

## 2026-10-15T18:10:00Z · 3.3 · main fast-forwarded to 49ff76c with the CI gate skipped

On Michael's instruction, main was fast-forwarded over cd529d9 (Backstage dependency refresh) and the
guard-proxy M0 to M2 commits. No workflow covers these paths (both are path-filtered), so CI never ran.
Verified locally on 49ff76c: guard-proxy `go test ./...`, the conformance suite against proxy.py and
the Go build; Backstage on Node 24 `yarn install --immutable`, `yarn tsc`, `yarn test`,
`yarn build:backend`; and `verify/test_proxy_checksum.py`, `test_image_pins.py`, `test_readme_current.py`.

## 2026-10-24T02:04:41Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 stays as sealed; guard-proxy#3 fixed ahead of M3

Michael reviewed the two points raised at M2 and wants no change: no `/prd-amend` for the claim that
M0 to M2 can replace proxy.py (the earliest real replacement point remains M4, as recorded on
2026-10-14), and the output guard keeps calling LLM Guard /analyze/output rather than an in-proxy regex.

guard-proxy#3 fixed in proxy.py (ccdda73). Each self-heal attempt is metered as it returns, including a
first attempt whose retry fails. /cost `requests` now counts model calls rather than turns, and a
/chat turn's input_tokens, output_tokens and cost_usd cover every attempt. Rejected: metering only on
success, because a failed retry's first attempt was still billed.

## 2026-10-24T04:50:43Z · 2.2 · Per-agent tool audit trail ported from the sister repo (#190)

`gitops/ai-layer/tool_audit.py` writes a `pre` and a `post` JSON line per workshop-mcp tool call, tagged
`agent_identity` from the `X-Agent-Identity` header the Agent CR sets with `headersFrom`. Only the hook
was ported; the sister's permission block (`bypassPermissions`) was not. Two departures from the sister's
`audit.sh`, both deliberate:

### REJECTED: logging the tool result, as the sister logs `tool_response`
**Why:** Our results are the leaked values (the recipe, the CEO's record, the sentinels), and every
container log also goes to Datadog (`containerCollectAll`), outside the span redaction the observability
act teaches. The record keeps the arguments, clipped, and the result's size.
**Do not suggest:** adding the result "for completeness". Attribution needs who, what and in what order,
and the arguments carry the attack.

### REJECTED: auditing inside evil-mcp-shim
**Why:** The shim stays dark for the reason recorded on #18 (PROGRESS.md, 2026-06-24): a rogue server that
helpfully reports on itself undermines the lesson. Rogue calls are attributed from the caller's side by
the agent's execute_tool spans. The agent's identity header is not sent to the shim either.
**Do not suggest:** importing tool_audit in `gitops/ai-layer/server.py`.
## 2026-10-24T04:59:40Z · question 575 · Close #110 as a tracker; the talk content gets one Barcelona issue

**Question 575:** #110's tracked work is either landed (#111, #114, #115) or deferred on purpose to
Barcelona (#112, #113, #116, #117). What happens to the parts with no child issue: the Hugging Face
2026-07-16 opener, the "other incidents worth a slide" list, the authorities to cite (OWASP, CISA / Five
Eyes, MITRE ATLAS, NIST COSAiS), and the C2/C3 verdicts?

**Answer:** Close #110 as a tracker now that its children are landed or deferred, and file one
deferred-barcelona issue for the opener, incident slides and citations.

**Decided by:** hecaton's research under Michael's standing rules, not by Michael. The basis is Michael's
own pattern on #112, #113, #116 and #117 (2026-09-07): post-Portland content is deferred to Barcelona on
its own labelled issue, kept open because the design work is still wanted.

**What it changes:** #110 stops being an open tracker. The four deferred child issues carry their own
work. The leftover talk content (opener, incident slides, citations, and the C2/C3 and ASI06 to ASI10
notes) moves to one new deferred-barcelona issue. No slide or lab prose changes here: that content is
still Michael's to write, and its dated facts get re-checked before they go on a slide.
`docs/research/2026-08-28-challenge-currency-review.md` records the disposition.

## 2026-10-24T09:30:00Z · #206 · Kyverno policies move from ClusterPolicy to CEL ValidatingPolicy

**Why now:** Michael's 2026-09-04 decision deferred this "past Portland"; Portland is past, and the
2026-09-07 review register records ClusterPolicy removal planned for Kyverno 1.20 (targeted October 2026).
Scope follows that decision exactly: Kyverno's own `policies.kyverno.io/v1` types, not native
ValidatingAdmissionPolicy. Nine `ValidatingPolicy` (the eight in `policies/kyverno/` plus
`policies/floor/minimal-floor.yaml`) and one `ImageValidatingPolicy` (`verify-image-signatures`). Every
policy keeps its name and every deny message is carried over word for word; Kyverno now prefixes it
`Policy <name> failed: `, so the refusal still names the policy.

**Choices made while porting:**
- The live toggle value is `Deny` (the CEL types' word for Enforce). `toggle-kyverno-enforce.sh` keeps its
  name and `--audit` flag; it replaces `/spec/validationActions`, which is also the ArgoCD ignoreDifferences
  path now (group `policies.kyverno.io`, kind `ValidatingPolicy`).
- `allowExistingViolations` has no CEL field. The pattern policies reproduce it in the expression: an
  UPDATE passes when the stored object already violated. It is gated on `request.operation == 'UPDATE'`,
  not on `oldObject != null`, because Kyverno 1.19 hands CEL an EMPTY MAP for a missing object (oldObject
  on CREATE and in background scans, object on DELETE). Read off the CLI and the engine source.
- Autogen stays on (it is the default) everywhere it was on before, which is what makes Beat 1's
  `kubectl create deployment` and C2's `deploy_app` fail at the Deployment. `deny-llm-endpoint-bypass`
  sets `autogen.podControllers.controllers: []`: the ClusterPolicy never had Deployment rules there
  (Kyverno skips autogen when a rule excludes by name).
- `minimal-floor` stays ONE policy with two validations, so the name the floor refuses with is unchanged.
- The ECR allow-list entry is a host-anchored regex (`^[^/]+\.dkr\.ecr\.[^/]+\.amazonaws\.com/`). The old
  wildcard `*.dkr.ecr.*.amazonaws.com/*` also admitted `evil.example/x.dkr.ecr.y.amazonaws.com/z`.

**New dev dependency:** the Kyverno CLI **v1.19.0** (2026-08-20, the deployed engine's version), used by
`verify/test_kyverno_cel_policies.py` (E2E suite; it fails loudly when the CLI is missing or a different
version). Why: a YAML render check cannot say a CEL expression evaluates. The CLI runs Kyverno's own engine
on fixture requests, with simulated users and UPDATE/DELETE, and verifies a real signed ghcr.io image
against the workshop key (and fails it under a different key).

**Not done here, and what it blocks:** guard-proxy's `/controls` C2 badge reads
`/apis/kyverno.io/v1/clusterpolicies/restrict-image-registries` and checks `failureAction == Enforce`
(guard-proxy-agenticburn `proxy.py`, pinned at `ccdda73`). That code is in the submodule's own repo. After
this lands the badge reads False until guard-proxy reads `/apis/policies.kyverno.io/v1/validatingpolicies/
restrict-image-registries` and tests `"Deny" in spec.validationActions`, and the pin is bumped. The
guard-proxy-reader ClusterRole here already grants that read. Promote the two together.

## 2026-10-24T07:36:04Z · #207 · The IAM half of the policy pipeline is built; the org half waits on access

**Scope follows the owner's 2026-09-04 direction on #207:** build the in-account permission-boundary
version and treat the org-level half as blocked until the provider grants management or delegated-admin
access to `o-pslkiycmqp`. No SCP, RCP or org S3 BPA document is drafted.

**Choices made:**
- **One boundary per account, not per cluster.** A role names its boundary by ARN. A boundary created in
  the same apply is either known only after apply (so no plan-time check can see it) or raced by
  CreateRole. `infra/org/boundary` creates `watch-it-burn-permissions-boundary` once per account, and the
  cluster root looks it up with a data source, so a cluster plan in an account without it fails at plan.
  **This adds a bootstrap step:** apply `infra/org/boundary` in each of the five accounts before the next
  `fleet.sh up`.
- **The boundary is Allow-everything plus Denies.** A strict allow-list ceiling would have to restate
  every AWS-managed policy the EKS cluster and node roles hold, and a missing service breaks a cluster
  live. The Allow is waived in `exceptions.md` with that reason. Its Denies are the in-account backstops:
  no unbounded CreateRole, no IAM escalation, no org or account calls, no public S3, no audit or key
  tampering.
- **Both Bedrock grants now carry a Condition** on the Pod Identity session tags (`eks-cluster-name`,
  `kubernetes-namespace`, plus `kubernetes-service-account` for the tutor). Check 3 asks this of every
  Allow, and it holds the grant to the cluster and namespace its associations already name. **Not yet
  seen live**: the next cluster's Bedrock beats are the check, and `test_iam_policy_aws.py` simulates it.
- **Check 3's rules cover permission policies only** (identity, boundary, SCP, RCP). Trust policies and
  KMS key policies are checked by Access Analyzer alone: key policies need `Resource: "*"`, and a trust
  policy's Allow is a grant to a principal, not a permission.
- **Upstream module policies are waived by address, with the reason.** These are the LB Controller, EBS
  CSI and ESO policies from terraform-aws-modules/eks-pod-identity, and the EKS module's cluster-encryption
  grant. They are AWS's published minimums, and the boundary still applies to them.
- **A new identity policy fails check 2 until accepted** (`--accept-new <address>`). There is nothing on
  main to compare it against, and passing it unseen would make check 2 skip whatever is new.
- **The E2E structural test renders today's roots without an AWS account.** `verify/iam_plan_render.py`
  points a copy at a local endpoint that answers only STS GetCallerIdentity and the boundary lookup. Any
  other call fails. A recorded fixture would go stale the first time main.tf changed.

**New dev dependency:** conftest **v0.71.1** (2026-10-06, bundles OPA 1.21.1), the issue's named engine for
check 3. Why Rego rather than Kyverno CEL: IAM's Action, Resource and Statement are each a string or an
array, and Rego has the prior art for that. It is used by `verify/test_iam_policy_structural.py` (E2E suite),
which fails loudly when conftest is missing or a different version.

**Not done, and why:** the SCPs, RCPs, org S3 BPA, the deny-manual-edits SCP, the break-glass and the
console-detach instructor beat all need org access we do not hold (#202). The OIDC `org-policies` GitHub
environment is a CI workflow and waits for the owner. "CI can write state" and "Datadog can still assume in"
have no subject: there is no CI role and no Datadog AWS role.

## 2026-10-24 · #240 · chat-ui removed; the console's Agent tab loads BurritoBot

chat-ui was not the kagent UI and not an A2A test client. It was a second nginx Deployment
(`ghcr.io/peopleforrester/watch-it-burn:nginx-1.27-alpine`) serving the older `index.html`/`app.js`
split-console chat, which posted A2A to `/a2a/` and polled `/cost`. Its only consumer was the "Agent
chat" iframe on `/console` (via `console.conf`'s `/chat/` route). Nothing in the lab, the deck, the tour,
the `platform` catalogue or the provisioning flow links `/console` or `/chat/`, and Michael measured zero
requests on watch-it-burn-pres-michael on 2026-09-05. So it had no consumer, and the issue says to remove
it in that case. The "developer's view of their agent" is already the real kagent UI, at
`kagent-<cluster>.agenticburn.com`, which the `platform` catalogue lists under exactly that description
(`platform.html:138`, `web-terminal/entrypoint.sh:84`). chat-ui showed none of that view.

- Removed the Deployment, the Service, the `chat-ui-src` generator, the `/chat/` route, and `web/index.html`
  plus `web/app.js`.
- `/console` stays, and its Agent tab now iframes `/burritbot`, so the split view drives the same chat surface
  students use. The runbook and the quickstart already describe the tab, so they stay accurate.
- `display.html`/`display.js` moved into `console-src`. They had shipped only in `chat-ui-src`, which kept
  `/display` returning 404 on clusters even after #338 added its route. `verify/test_console_service_vhosts.py`
  now checks that every `try_files` page is packaged in `console-src`, not just that it has a location.

## 2026-10-24T12:05:21Z · #333 · deny-llm-endpoint-bypass exercised live; its name exemption removed

The issue asked for one live test: create a pod of the bypass shape and read the PolicyReport. That test is
`verify/test_llm_bypass_live.py` (E2E suite, `CONTEXT` required). It was run on 2026-10-24 against Kyverno
v1.19.1, which is what chart 3.9.1 in `gitops/apps/kyverno.yaml` deploys. No EKS cluster was provisioned
for it: the run used a local kube-apiserver and controller-manager 1.35.9 with etcd, the chart's CRDs and
RBAC, and the real admission and reports controllers out of cluster with the chart's own arguments. The
real guard-proxy and agentgateway Deployments from `kubectl kustomize gitops/ai-layer` were loaded too.

**What it showed.** The policy as shipped does match its own shape. A bare Pod and a Deployment's Pod with
a public `*_BASE_URL` each got `fail` with the policy's message, through both the admission webhook (an
EphemeralReport with `audit.kyverno.io/source: admission`) and the background scan. One quirk: Kyverno
1.19.1 sets the result property `process: background scan` on admission results as well, so that
property cannot tell the two paths apart.

**What it found.** The matchCondition skipped any pod whose name started with `guard-proxy` or
`agentgateway`. The API server names a ReplicaSet's pods before admission, so an agent-made Deployment
called `guard-proxy-anything` produced pods the policy never evaluated. No report recorded them at all.
Init containers were never checked either, and they got `pass`. The exemption protected nothing: in the
rendered ai-layer, neither guard-proxy nor agentgateway sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or
`OPENAI_API_BASE`.

- The exemption is removed and init containers are checked. The policy stays `Audit`, as the issue asked.
- The live test also reads the reports of the running guard-proxy and agentgateway pods and needs `pass`
  on each. That is the policy's own precondition for promoting it to Deny. The test also refuses to judge
  a cluster whose installed policy differs from the repo's file.
- Proof that the test can fail: with the old policy on both sides it failed exactly the impostor (no
  result) and the init container (`pass`). With the old policy on the cluster and the new one in the repo,
  it failed the spec comparison.

## 2026-10-24 · #359 · The student's cluster name is the memorable host; a-NNN is retired, not an alias

The issue asked which name is canonical for a student and whether `a-NNN.agenticburn.com` is a permanent
alias. Michael settled it in 4a1fa58 (2026-09-08): the alias is a leftover. It survived the #142 rename
only so that links handed out before the rename still resolved, and none is still outstanding.

- **Canonical:** the two-word host that `public_host_for()` / `friendly_attendee_name()` return (slot 1
  is `bane-sabrina.agenticburn.com`). The claim page shows its first label, and that label is what a
  student says to a facilitator.
- **Not a name:** `watch-it-burn-attendee-<id>` is the provisioning slot id (`docs/BUILD-SPEC.md` §5).
- **Retired:** `a-NNN` and `r1-1`. `fleet.sh routes` emits neither, so a stale reference 404s instead of
  quietly working. The routes shrink guard does not count the old `a-NNN` rows, so dropping them is not
  mistaken for losing hosts.
- Still left from #359: provisioning-agenticburn's `STUDENT_PREVIEW_CONSOLE_URL` defaults to
  `https://a-001.agenticburn.com`. That default now points at a host that is never served, so it has to
  change in that repo. It is filed there as a follow-up.

## 2026-10-24 · #451 · The event knob sets the storefront's Feedback link and the projector QR; segno 1.6.6

The storefront's Feedback button was hardcoded to `feedback.agenticburn.com/quick`, and the feedback app stays
off for the KubeCon breakout (#448). The destination is now set per event in `gitops/ai-layer/web/event.js`,
shipped in the console ConfigMap next to `active-skin.js`, and never edited into the page.

- **Per event, not per cluster.** The fleet is rebuilt for each event, and the console never learns its own
  public host (console.conf, #152). A knob the page reads in the browser is the one place both the community
  and the admin clusters get the same answer without a guard-proxy change in its own repo.
- **The survey URL goes out verbatim.** It is a third party's page, so the cluster and user the workshop
  appends for `/quick` (#364, #383) are not added. Only an `https://` value is used; anything else leaves the
  workshop default.
- **The value** is the answer to question 147 (BurritoBot repo #80), given by the coordinator under Michael's
  standing rules: `https://kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2026.sessionize.com/session/1249553`. Whether
  it shows this talk is checked once Sessionize opens rating (`facilitation/kubecon-na-2026-phone-check.md`).
- **The QR** is rendered from `publicUrl` in the same file by `scripts/audience-qr.py`, so the slide and the
  page cannot name two addresses. **segno 1.6.6** (PyPI, current on 2026-10-24) renders it: pure Python, no
  native libraries, and deterministic, so `verify/test_audience_page_e2e.py` can compare the committed SVG
  byte for byte. It is used only through `uv run --with segno==1.6.6`, never installed into the offline
  suite's interpreter. The offline suite reads the URL from the SVG's `<title>` instead.
