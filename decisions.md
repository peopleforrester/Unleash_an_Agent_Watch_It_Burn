# Decisions Log

Append-only audit trail of approvals, amendments, backward steps, and conditional-skip
rationales for the lifecycle. See [[state-persistence]] for the schema.

Note: this repo already keeps a rich technical decision + verification log at
`docs/DECISION-LOG.md` (PRD approvals/amendments, the model-refusal rerun evidence, the
Nova A/B). That remains the detailed record. This file carries lifecycle phase-transition
entries from init-state forward.

## 2026-07-05 · init · state persistence initialized

init-state migrated the pre-lifecycle `PROJECT_STATE.md` to the lifecycle schema (header
prepended, 812-line body preserved). Deduced Phase 1.3 (PRD 35 sealed at
2026-07-03T19:59:22Z, sha256 5e110e425e70; Phase 2 M1 pending). Prior lifecycle events
(PRD 35 approval / amendment / re-approval) are recorded in `docs/DECISION-LOG.md` and are
not re-imported here.

## 2026-07-07 · skip · §4.6-d (per-cluster model tier) deferred

Michael deferred §4.6-d (per-cluster tier -> Agent modelConfig patch), the last of PRD 35 M1's
sub-pieces. It is a CONDITIONAL skip with a recorded reason (not a silent drop):

- "Nova everywhere" is the gitops default, so per-cluster tier only serves the OPTIONAL cost-race
  demo, which is not currently wanted.
- Both viable implementations wrangle ArgoCD reconciliation: (a) live-patch = suspend the ai-layer
  app's selfHeal, patch the Agent modelConfig, bounce the pod; (b) the PRD-preferred "overlay" =
  patch the ai-layer ArgoCD Application's kustomize.patches per cluster, which the app-of-apps parent
  reverts unless given ignoreDifferences. Neither is friction-free, so the PRD's "not a live patch"
  preference did not survive contact with the shared-gitops + app-of-apps + selfHeal architecture.
- The tier column stays plumbed (roster + dry-run show it) but is inert until this lands.

Consequence: PRD 35 M1 is COMPLETE at 4 of 5 sub-pieces (IMDS pin, §4.6 core, AWS root relocation,
provider dispatch — all on main). Revisit §4.6-d only if the cost-race demo is wanted; the live-patch
route is the recommended implementation, and a one-line PRD note would capture that the overlay
preference is impractical here. The sealed PRD 35 body is unchanged (this is a documented deferral in
the audit log, not a plan amendment).

## 2026-09-03T18:20:00Z · 2.2 · Rejected approaches for rolling a proxy.py change

### REJECTED: Per-generator `options: disableNameSuffixHash: false` on `guard-proxy-src`
**Why:** kustomize v5.8.1 lets the top-level `generatorOptions` win over a per-generator
`options:` block. Confirmed with a minimal two-generator build: one generator asking for a
hash and one not both produced unsuffixed names. The field is accepted and silently has no
effect, which is worse than an error.
**Status:** Permanent for kustomize v5.x as shipped in kubectl v1.37.
**Do not suggest:** moving the `options:` key, reordering the generators, or setting
`disableNameSuffixHash: false` on the generator alone. All three hit the same precedence.

### REJECTED: Drop the global `generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash`
**Why:** It would hash every generated ConfigMap in the ai-layer bundle, not just the
proxy source, days before Portland. Kustomize rewrites the references it owns, but the
blast radius covers `evil-mcp-src`, `workshop-mcp-src`, `chat-ui-src` and the rest, and the
stable names are relied on by `agent/gateway/guard-proxy/guard-proxy.yaml` and by the
`kubectl create configmap` line documented in it.
**Status:** Revisit between events, when a wider rename can be tested on one cluster first.
**Do not suggest:** doing it as part of a security fix. The two changes have nothing to do
with each other and bundling them makes both harder to revert.

### REJECTED: `kubectl rollout restart` across the fleet
**Why:** The fleet's admission policy rejects direct mutation by a non-ArgoCD principal, and
it is right to. Eleven of thirteen clusters refused; `r1-1` and `r1-2` accepted, which is
itself worth a look since the policy is evidently not uniform.
**Status:** Permanent. Changes travel through Git.
**Do not suggest:** a one-off restart to "just get it live", including via a Job or a
scaled-to-zero-and-back. The policy exists so the running state matches the repo.

**Chosen:** a `checksum/proxy-py` annotation on the guard-proxy pod template, bumped in the
same commit as a proxy.py change, with `verify/test_proxy_checksum.py` failing when the two
disagree. Keeps the stable ConfigMap names, makes the rollout automatic once the annotation
moves, and turns a forgotten bump into a red test instead of a silent no-op in the room.

## 2026-09-06T13:30:00Z · 2.2 · Supersedes "Drop the global generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash" (rejected 2026-09-03)

The 2026-09-03 rejection was conditional: "Revisit between events, when a wider rename can be tested
on one cluster first." The condition changed on 2026-09-06: the owner directed that every fix be wired
so it needs no manual step, four freshly rebuilt clusters exist to prove the rename on before Sunday's
full rebuild, and the one runtime reliance the rejection named (`agent/gateway/guard-proxy/guard-proxy.yaml`)
is a hand-apply manifest nothing in gitops, infra or verify applies. The hash is now ON for the whole
ai-layer bundle; `verify/test_ai_layer_rollout.py` asserts it, and asserts that editing lab.html changes
the console pod template. The `checksum/proxy-py` annotation and its test stay: `/controls` reports that
checksum in the room, which is a different job from rolling the pod. Issue #252.

## 2026-09-17T15:40:00Z · 1.2 · Gitea is not part of this IDP, and the reason was never written down

Asked why the IDP has no Gitea. It has none, and searching this repo for "gitea" returns nothing at
all: not a manifest, not a note, not a rejection. The absence was undocumented, which is the actual
defect here. A decision nobody recorded gets re-litigated, and this one had already reached the point
of being asked.

**What is true.** The sister project (`events/Packt-agentic-devops`) does run Gitea, at
`solution/platform/1-foundation/gitea`, beside openbao, argo-rollouts and argo-workflows. Its own
ABOUTME states the purpose exactly:

> in-cluster Gitea installed at PROVISIONING time, so ArgoCD can source the platform manifests from
> inside the cluster instead of from GitHub

The port commit that founded this platform (`6880677`, "Port KubeAuto IDP foundation") brought **zero**
Gitea files.

### REJECTED: add Gitea to the Watch It Burn IDP

**Why:** it solves a problem this workshop does not have. Gitea exists in the sister project because
its students sync the platform from **inside** the cluster, editing manifests in an in-cluster git
service as a teaching beat. Our Argo CD sources directly from GitHub through the `witb-repo` secret
and a `gh` token, and no challenge asks a student to commit anything. Adding Gitea would add a
StatefulSet, a database, a credential and a sync path that nothing in the eight challenges exercises,
on a platform already at 38 Applications that must build in 15 to 25 minutes, 50 times over.

**Status:** Revisit when a challenge genuinely needs in-cluster git. The obvious candidate is a
supply-chain or GitOps-tampering beat, where the student modifies a manifest and watches Argo CD or
the drift policy react. That is a real workshop idea and Gitea would be the right way to build it. It
does not exist today.

**Do not suggest:** adding Gitea "for completeness" or because the sister repo has it; mirroring the
GitHub repo into the cluster purely to remove the GitHub dependency (the token path works and is one
secret); or treating its absence as an oversight from the port. The port was manifests-only by
design, and the same mechanism is why `kubeauto-unicorn-party:2.0.2` did not come across either: its
content lived inside an image in a foreign ECR registry rather than in a manifest.

## 2026-10-05T00:00:00Z · 1.3 · Component repos, the guard-proxy rewrite, and the upstream mirror

Five decisions from Michael, taken one at a time on 2026-10-05, closing the open questions on #411,
#412 and #416.

**Component repos (#411).** guard-proxy and the LLM Guard offline image each get their own repo,
wired back here as git submodules (submodules chosen 2026-09-24):

| Component | Repo | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| guard-proxy | `peopleforrester/guard-proxy-agenticburn` | public |
| LLM Guard offline image | `peopleforrester/llm-guard-cpu-offline` | public |

Both public, matching this repo and the images, which are already anonymously pullable. Neither holds
a secret: the cosign signing key lives in mrf-secrets.

**guard-proxy is rewritten in Go (#412).** Michael's reasoning: it is going to become a product
quickly, and Go has better libraries for this than Rust. This reverses the recommendation in the
2026-09-22 research synthesis, which was to keep it in Python as the workshop's demo object; that
recommendation assumed it stayed a teaching prop, and it does not.

The rewrite also folds in what LiteLLM does better. The research established that LiteLLM's
pre-call budget reservation (estimate the request's maximum cost, reserve it, reject before the
provider is called) is a stronger mechanism than guard-proxy's post-hoc metering, which blocks only
the next request. That gap analysis is the first deliverable of the rewrite, ahead of any Go code.

**Upstream mirror (#416).** `peopleforrester/llm-guard-upstream-mirror`, private. A backup so builds
survive if Protect AI deletes the archived repo; it invites nothing and promises nothing. The public
offering is `llm-guard-cpu-offline`. Forking and maintaining the library (decision B) stays declined
on the cost measured in the 2026-09-22 research.

## 2026-10-11T00:00:00Z · 1.2 · PRD #412 open questions answered

Michael answered the five open questions in `prds/412-guard-proxy-go-rewrite.md`, one at a time:

1. Token counting is exact, via Bedrock `CountTokens`, with no estimator fallback: a request whose
   count cannot be produced is refused.
2. Budget state persists across restarts in an embedded store (SQLite or bbolt), so a restart cannot
   reset a budget. Still no Postgres.
3. The workshop apparatus (live prompt feed, `/controls`, `/toggle`) ships in the product. Design
   consequence recorded in the PRD: the prompt feed is off by default and the admin API is
   authenticated, because the feed streams user prompts.
4. The code fast-edit loop is retired. Code reaches a cluster only as a signed, digest-pinned image;
   behavior still changes live through the YAML config and the toggles.
5. License is Apache-2.0. `proxy.py` keeps its MIT notice, because its LICENSE names Michael Forrester
   and Whitney Lee as holders and relicensing it would need both. The Go code is new and is
   Apache-2.0 from its first commit.

The plan as a whole still needs approval (1.3) before any Go is written.

## 2026-10-10T23:36:09Z · 1.3 · PRD #412 approved: guard-proxy rewritten in Go

Approved-by: Michael@2026-10-10T23:36:09Z
Plan: `prds/412-guard-proxy-go-rewrite.md` (sha256:3a5aa82f1a71f5c30360c684aa873704df14374e9468b63e50bc7d5fd118ac73)

Approved as written, after Michael answered its five open questions one at a time and the known bugs
on the new proxy's path were classified (#382 and #320 deferred against a Python baseline, #333 a
prerequisite for M7). The plan is now read-only; changes go through an amendment.

Work starts at M0: a black-box HTTP conformance suite that must pass against the Python proxy before
any Go is written. It lives in guard-proxy-agenticburn, beside the implementation it constrains.

## 2026-10-11T00:29:21Z · 2.1 · PRD #412 M0 complete: conformance suite pinned to proxy.py

The suite lives in guard-proxy-agenticburn `conformance/`, beside the code it constrains. It runs
any implementation as a subprocess through `GUARD_PROXY_CMD` against real local fakes for the agent
and the LLM Guard API, and asserts only client-observable behavior. Result: 163 tests green against
proxy.py, CI green on c72cc28, promoted to that repo's main.

Proof that it constrains anything: `mutation_check.py` breaks proxy.py 16 ways (fail-open default,
case-sensitive block-list, ignored classifier verdict, scrub gaps, cap and rate-limit off-by-ones,
session-blind budget, wrong price, probe in feed, no retries, CORS echo, credential forwarding).
All 16 are caught. The first run let the cost-cap off-by-one escape; the boundary tests that close
it were added, and a budget-cap mutant with them.

Scope clarifications, within the sealed plan rather than amendments:
- Telemetry assertions are deferred to M5, whose acceptance is already a recorded Python baseline.
  The Python proxy only emits spans under the OTel SDK the cluster injects, so the harness cannot
  observe them without reproducing that injection.
- `/controls` is covered for the no-credentials case only. proxy.py hardcodes the API host; the Go
  implementation adds an endpoint override and the suite extends then.

Defects found while pinning behavior are asserted as they stand (tests ending `_today`) and filed on
guard-proxy-agenticburn: #1 (a failed reasoning-only retry writes two responses and drops the usable
reply), #2 (raw `<thinking></thinking>` tags reach the student), #3 (retry tokens are never metered,
so `/cost` and both caps undercount), #4 (feed moderation misses capitalized terms). Per the
fix-shared-bugs rule these sit on the Go proxy's path. #3 bears directly on the M3 claim that a
single request cannot exceed the cap, so it must be fixed in both implementations before M3 is
accepted. #1, #2 and #4 can be fixed in either order, as long as proxy.py and its `_today` test
change together.

## 2026-10-14T00:00:00Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 M1 complete: Go skeleton passes the pass-through conformance subset

guard-proxy-agenticburn 1874403, CI green (run 38490687225), promoted. "Pass-through cases" is now a
pytest marker, `passthrough`, on 22 tests: /guards seeding, the GET passthrough and its 502s, A2A
forwarding with every guard off, agent failures as 502 with a `forward_error` ERROR log, and OPTIONS
as 501. Each later milestone widens the selection; proxy.py always runs all 163. Choices made inside
the contract, each recorded so a later milestone does not re-derive it:
- Go 1.27.2 rather than the PRD's 1.27.1: 1.27.2 (2026-10-08) carries `net/http` security fixes. An
  upward patch, so no amendment is needed.
- The agent URL is required. proxy.py defaults to a workshop hostname; the manifests set AGENT_URL
  explicitly (resources.yaml), so nothing deployed depends on the default.
- `PROXY_TIMEOUT` becomes a total deadline (`http.Client.Timeout`). urllib's is per socket operation.
- Routes later milestones build (/chat, /cost, /prompts, /controls, /toggle) answer 501 instead of
  being forwarded to the agent as A2A traffic. `/healthz` is new and is answered locally.
- Log timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC; proxy.py writes Python's local `formatTime`. Keys and level names
  match, including WARNING.
- Licensing: Apache-2.0 in `LICENSE` for the Go code. proxy.py and `conformance/` keep MIT, moved to
  `LICENSE-MIT`, because both were committed under the MIT notice naming Michael and Whitney.
- The upstream hop is a rebuilt request on `http.Client`, not `httputil.ReverseProxy`, because the
  reference sends only the body and a JSON Content-Type.

Also closed #415 (all items done or tracked on #412 and llm-coding-workflow#182) and corrected the
state file, which still said the cosign key existed only on netcup after mrf-secrets#4 had closed.

## 2026-10-14T21:40:00Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 M2 complete on the A2A path; /chat guard cases wait for /chat

guard-proxy-agenticburn 0679083, CI green (run 38640241252), promoted. A second marker, `guards`,
covers the 22 guard cases on the A2A path: the block-list, the LLM Guard classifier, the output guard
over artifacts, agent history and status, and fail-closed or fail-open for each failure mode. The Go
build runs `-m "passthrough or guards"`, 44 tests; proxy.py still runs all 163. Choices made inside
the contract:
- **Scope.** The guard cases on `/chat` (test_chat_path.py) and the live-toggle case need the `/chat`
  route and `/toggle`, which carry per-call cost, retries and toggles from M3 and M4. They join when
  those routes do. The guard logic is shared, so they exercise the same code. Consequence: the PRD's
  "M0 through M2 is the minimum to replace the Python in the workshop" does not hold. The workshop
  needs `/chat` and `/toggle`, so the earliest replacement point is M4.
- **The output guard calls LLM Guard's `/analyze/output`, as proxy.py does.** The PRD's milestone
  says "regex output"; the regex is LLM Guard's Regex scanner, server side. A regex guard inside the
  proxy would be a new guard rather than parity, and no conformance case asks for one.
- `llm_guard.url` (or `LLM_GUARD_URL`) is required, like the agent URL; the manifests set it.
- `PROXY_FAIL_CLOSED` accepts only true or false. proxy.py treats any other value as false, so a typo
  turned fail-closed off.
- A scanner failure logs `guard_error` at WARNING. proxy.py fails, open or closed, without a log line.
- `LLM_GUARD_TOKEN` is environment only, never in the YAML; with no token no Authorization header is
  sent, instead of `Bearer ` with nothing after it.
- Guards are concrete types (a Blocklist, an LLM Guard client) rather than the PRD's Go interface.
  The interface arrives with a second implementation (Bedrock ApplyGuardrail), when its shape is known.

Correction to the prior entry: its timestamp `2026-10-14T00:00:00Z` is a placeholder. The M1 record
was committed at 2026-10-14T00:35:44Z (152485f).

## 2026-10-15T18:10:00Z · 3.3 · main fast-forwarded to 49ff76c with the CI gate skipped

On Michael's instruction, main was fast-forwarded over cd529d9 (Backstage dependency refresh) and the
guard-proxy M0 to M2 commits. No workflow covers these paths (both are path-filtered), so CI never ran.
Verified locally on 49ff76c: guard-proxy `go test ./...`, the conformance suite against proxy.py and
the Go build; Backstage on Node 24 `yarn install --immutable`, `yarn tsc`, `yarn test`,
`yarn build:backend`; and `verify/test_proxy_checksum.py`, `test_image_pins.py`, `test_readme_current.py`.

## 2026-10-24T02:04:41Z · 2.2 · PRD #412 stays as sealed; guard-proxy#3 fixed ahead of M3

Michael reviewed the two points raised at M2 and wants no change: no `/prd-amend` for the claim that
M0 to M2 can replace proxy.py (the earliest real replacement point remains M4, as recorded on
2026-10-14), and the output guard keeps calling LLM Guard /analyze/output rather than an in-proxy regex.

guard-proxy#3 fixed in proxy.py (ccdda73). Each self-heal attempt is metered as it returns, including a
first attempt whose retry fails. /cost `requests` now counts model calls rather than turns, and a
/chat turn's input_tokens, output_tokens and cost_usd cover every attempt. Rejected: metering only on
success, because a failed retry's first attempt was still billed.

## 2026-10-24T04:50:43Z · 2.2 · Per-agent tool audit trail ported from the sister repo (#190)

`gitops/ai-layer/tool_audit.py` writes a `pre` and a `post` JSON line per workshop-mcp tool call, tagged
`agent_identity` from the `X-Agent-Identity` header the Agent CR sets with `headersFrom`. Only the hook
was ported; the sister's permission block (`bypassPermissions`) was not. Two departures from the sister's
`audit.sh`, both deliberate:

### REJECTED: logging the tool result, as the sister logs `tool_response`
**Why:** Our results are the leaked values (the recipe, the CEO's record, the sentinels), and every
container log also goes to Datadog (`containerCollectAll`), outside the span redaction the observability
act teaches. The record keeps the arguments, clipped, and the result's size.
**Do not suggest:** adding the result "for completeness". Attribution needs who, what and in what order,
and the arguments carry the attack.

### REJECTED: auditing inside evil-mcp-shim
**Why:** The shim stays dark for the reason recorded on #18 (PROGRESS.md, 2026-06-24): a rogue server that
helpfully reports on itself undermines the lesson. Rogue calls are attributed from the caller's side by
the agent's execute_tool spans. The agent's identity header is not sent to the shim either.
**Do not suggest:** importing tool_audit in `gitops/ai-layer/server.py`.
## 2026-10-24T04:59:40Z · question 575 · Close #110 as a tracker; the talk content gets one Barcelona issue

**Question 575:** #110's tracked work is either landed (#111, #114, #115) or deferred on purpose to
Barcelona (#112, #113, #116, #117). What happens to the parts with no child issue: the Hugging Face
2026-07-16 opener, the "other incidents worth a slide" list, the authorities to cite (OWASP, CISA / Five
Eyes, MITRE ATLAS, NIST COSAiS), and the C2/C3 verdicts?

**Answer:** Close #110 as a tracker now that its children are landed or deferred, and file one
deferred-barcelona issue for the opener, incident slides and citations.

**Decided by:** hecaton's research under Michael's standing rules, not by Michael. The basis is Michael's
own pattern on #112, #113, #116 and #117 (2026-09-07): post-Portland content is deferred to Barcelona on
its own labelled issue, kept open because the design work is still wanted.

**What it changes:** #110 stops being an open tracker. The four deferred child issues carry their own
work. The leftover talk content (opener, incident slides, citations, and the C2/C3 and ASI06 to ASI10
notes) moves to one new deferred-barcelona issue. No slide or lab prose changes here: that content is
still Michael's to write, and its dated facts get re-checked before they go on a slide.
`docs/research/2026-08-28-challenge-currency-review.md` records the disposition.
