# Decisions Log

Append-only audit trail of approvals, amendments, backward steps, and conditional-skip
rationales for the lifecycle. See [[state-persistence]] for the schema.

Note: this repo already keeps a rich technical decision + verification log at
`docs/DECISION-LOG.md` (PRD approvals/amendments, the model-refusal rerun evidence, the
Nova A/B). That remains the detailed record. This file carries lifecycle phase-transition
entries from init-state forward.

## 2026-07-05 · init · state persistence initialized

init-state migrated the pre-lifecycle `PROJECT_STATE.md` to the lifecycle schema (header
prepended, 812-line body preserved). Deduced Phase 1.3 (PRD 35 sealed at
2026-07-03T19:59:22Z, sha256 5e110e425e70; Phase 2 M1 pending). Prior lifecycle events
(PRD 35 approval / amendment / re-approval) are recorded in `docs/DECISION-LOG.md` and are
not re-imported here.

## 2026-07-07 · skip · §4.6-d (per-cluster model tier) deferred

Michael deferred §4.6-d (per-cluster tier -> Agent modelConfig patch), the last of PRD 35 M1's
sub-pieces. It is a CONDITIONAL skip with a recorded reason (not a silent drop):

- "Nova everywhere" is the gitops default, so per-cluster tier only serves the OPTIONAL cost-race
  demo, which is not currently wanted.
- Both viable implementations wrangle ArgoCD reconciliation: (a) live-patch = suspend the ai-layer
  app's selfHeal, patch the Agent modelConfig, bounce the pod; (b) the PRD-preferred "overlay" =
  patch the ai-layer ArgoCD Application's kustomize.patches per cluster, which the app-of-apps parent
  reverts unless given ignoreDifferences. Neither is friction-free, so the PRD's "not a live patch"
  preference did not survive contact with the shared-gitops + app-of-apps + selfHeal architecture.
- The tier column stays plumbed (roster + dry-run show it) but is inert until this lands.

Consequence: PRD 35 M1 is COMPLETE at 4 of 5 sub-pieces (IMDS pin, §4.6 core, AWS root relocation,
provider dispatch — all on main). Revisit §4.6-d only if the cost-race demo is wanted; the live-patch
route is the recommended implementation, and a one-line PRD note would capture that the overlay
preference is impractical here. The sealed PRD 35 body is unchanged (this is a documented deferral in
the audit log, not a plan amendment).

## 2026-09-03T18:20:00Z · 2.2 · Rejected approaches for rolling a proxy.py change

### REJECTED: Per-generator `options: disableNameSuffixHash: false` on `guard-proxy-src`
**Why:** kustomize v5.8.1 lets the top-level `generatorOptions` win over a per-generator
`options:` block. Confirmed with a minimal two-generator build: one generator asking for a
hash and one not both produced unsuffixed names. The field is accepted and silently has no
effect, which is worse than an error.
**Status:** Permanent for kustomize v5.x as shipped in kubectl v1.37.
**Do not suggest:** moving the `options:` key, reordering the generators, or setting
`disableNameSuffixHash: false` on the generator alone. All three hit the same precedence.

### REJECTED: Drop the global `generatorOptions.disableNameSuffixHash`
**Why:** It would hash every generated ConfigMap in the ai-layer bundle, not just the
proxy source, days before Portland. Kustomize rewrites the references it owns, but the
blast radius covers `evil-mcp-src`, `workshop-mcp-src`, `chat-ui-src` and the rest, and the
stable names are relied on by `agent/gateway/guard-proxy/guard-proxy.yaml` and by the
`kubectl create configmap` line documented in it.
**Status:** Revisit between events, when a wider rename can be tested on one cluster first.
**Do not suggest:** doing it as part of a security fix. The two changes have nothing to do
with each other and bundling them makes both harder to revert.

### REJECTED: `kubectl rollout restart` across the fleet
**Why:** The fleet's admission policy rejects direct mutation by a non-ArgoCD principal, and
it is right to. Eleven of thirteen clusters refused; `r1-1` and `r1-2` accepted, which is
itself worth a look since the policy is evidently not uniform.
**Status:** Permanent. Changes travel through Git.
**Do not suggest:** a one-off restart to "just get it live", including via a Job or a
scaled-to-zero-and-back. The policy exists so the running state matches the repo.

**Chosen:** a `checksum/proxy-py` annotation on the guard-proxy pod template, bumped in the
same commit as a proxy.py change, with `verify/test_proxy_checksum.py` failing when the two
disagree. Keeps the stable ConfigMap names, makes the rollout automatic once the annotation
moves, and turns a forgotten bump into a red test instead of a silent no-op in the room.
